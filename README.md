# Ask Mr. Protocol

This is a collection of columns from the mid 1980s with networking and
unix system humor by Mike O'Brien.

As a young college intern in Ohio I was responsible for maintaning the UUCP
system for my employer. At the time I stumbled upon, chuckled over and
quirrelled away printouts of columns by Mike O'Brien about network issues.
A book with this material has gone out of print:

I am not the author!  Thanks to a scanner and OCR I can post this material
so others can enjoy it. I have not been able to find Mike O'Brien, so if
anyone knows him please pass this along!
