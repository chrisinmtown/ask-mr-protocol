# Ask Mr. Protocol

This is a collection of columns from the mid 1980s with networking and
unix system humor by Mike O'Brien.

As a young college intern in Ohio I was responsible for maintaning the UUCP
system for my employer. At the time I stumbled upon, chuckled over and
quirrelled away printouts of columns by Mike O'Brien about network issues.
A book with this material has gone out of print:

I am not the author! Thanks to a scanner and OCR I can post this material so 
others can enjoy it. I fixed all the OCR errors I could find.  I could not 
find Mike O'Brien so if anyone knows him please pass this along!

Yes, the dates jump around inconsistently.
I simply reproduced the printed copies faithfully.
